This is my portfolio I created using PHP, html/css and JavaScript. I created a page for my projects and currently have 4 projects listed. My first project is a to do list that I created by dynamically adding and removing HTML tables with JavaScript. My second project is my PHP playground. This is where I tested and learned about processing HTML forms with PHP. My third project is a Mars Rover image viewer. You select a day and then the cameras for that day are dyncamically loaded into a dropdown for you to select. Once the day and the camera are selected, you can view the images from that day using the NASA API. My fourth project is a dog photo sharing app I made. You can view random dog facts, view the dog gallery or load a picture of a selected dog breed. There is also a feature to log in which adds more features. After logging in, you can add your own pictures of your dogs, this creates a personalized gallery as well as adds the picture to the main gallery. Usernames and images are stored in a mySQL database.
